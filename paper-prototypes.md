This upper left corner sketch is the ui that when the user's request gets accepted by another user, the post owner can see the information of the person who accepted the request. The rest three are the UI for the find feature after you click a request that you are interested in.

This UI Sketch implements the map API to show the current general location of the user to indicate the location where they are dining. The map functions inclue zooming in and out of the map and a physical button to return back to current location. On the 1st pane, it shows the location's name and has a text box for the user to describe the dining locationa and their characteristics so the other person can identify them when they arrive. In the 2nd pane, the user sees their post on the homepage whihc other users will see and they can see the status of their request and can cancel their request if they want.
