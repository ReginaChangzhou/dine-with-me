# Elevator Pitch
(using Heilmeier’s Catechism)
## What are you trying to do? Articulate your objectives using absolutely no jargon.
Our web app aims to get more students to meet one another by taking advantage of the extra table spaces 
that is available in busy dining areas. 

## How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
In UCSD, it is hard to find seats during lunch time since the students population is large.
Currently, people occupy the first empty table they see and stay there until they have finished their meal.
When all tables have been filled by at least one person, people who need a seat could ask to sit with a person
at a table where there are available seats, but most tend to keep looking for an empty table or seat they can
occupy to eat their meal in comfort like everyone else. It has been common rule that when you see a stranger,
you should keep your distance. With this mentality, the situation mentioned earlier will repeat. Looking for 
seats takes time and avoiding strangers is also tiring which could result in taking more time to recharge their 
energy. Even in the case that two strangers are (forced to) sitting down together, it is very rare that the two will chat with each other. They usually just sit in silence while finishing their meals. It is embarrassing for both side and probably no good for mood and digestion.

## What’s new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
With our approach, users are able to confirm a spot to dine at by a member that also uses the app to request for 
someone to dine with at their table. Since, their profiles is linked to their Facebook profiles, it would relieve the 
tension between the two (or more) members if they knew each other beforehand. We think it will be successful,
because we are using the Google Map API to display the available dine requests and give directions to how to 
get to the dining place, it would be easy for them to meet up as the interface is well known. 

## Who cares? If you’re successful, what difference will it make?
1. It will be easier to find a seat nearby during rush lunch hours 
2. People will meet new people with similar interests or people they are interested in during lunch time
3. The atmosphere on the lunch table will no long be embarrassing and silent. Everyone can be engaged in a friendly environment.
