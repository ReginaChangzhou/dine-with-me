## Project title
## Maximum 140-character “tweet length” catchy summary of project
## A single storyboard illustrating the compelling need that your project satisfies. This should ideally be based on one of your original storyboards, but could be different too if you want to change ideas
## Description of what pieces of feedback that you took from classmates and your TA to settle on this idea
## Description of your proposed project’s features. You can add UI sketches here if you want, but no need for a full paper prototype
## A description of how you will split the programming work amongst your 4 team members. Remember: everyone should write code!
