# Dine With Me

### Summary of Project
By searching nearby people and restaurants in UCSD, Dine With Me helps you to deal with embarrassment of lonely dining and make new friends!

### Storyboard
A single storyboard illustrating the compelling need that your project satisfies. This should ideally be based on one of your original storyboards, but could be different too if you want to change ideas

### Feedbacks
From the feedbacks from classmates and storyboards from other groups, there are lots of similar ideas of Task-Catcher, Lost and Found and Trip Planning in the class. For the idea of UCSD Exploring Map, people might want to keep their privacy and are not willing to share their stories. Event Scheduling and Router is more related to reminder than map. The ideas of Resource Locator and trip planning are too complicated and are unrealistic to achieve for us in a few weeks. Therefore, we would like to come up a new idea that can help users to find nearby people to dine together at nearby restaurants in USCD. We have already talked with TA and believe this is a unique area that worths to explore. Currently, lots of students are afraid of or tired of eating alone and also need an opportunity to build social network. Lunch or Dinner time is a great chance. Moreover, during busy hours, restaurants are crazy crowdy and sharing tables can improve the rate of utilization. We believe that there is a large user need on this field and Dine With Me can help them to solve these problems.
