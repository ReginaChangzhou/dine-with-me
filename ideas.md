Idea 1 is inspired by TaskRabbit. The application primarily helps users to take everyday tasks and get extra payment in their most convenient and efficient way. It is like a marketplace that matches the task-taker with local demand along the way from start location to destination, allowing task-requester to find immediate help with everyday tasks. The application helps people take back their lives, be their own boss, help people out and make some money on their road. The system will helps the task-requesters to find nearby task-takers to carry out their work and it also helps the task-takers to plan optimal way to finish the tasks. Moreover, it has potential to shape a new form of labor market that provides simple tasks, short-term jobs and long-term jobs.


Idea 2 is trip planning. The development of transportation and improvement of lifestyle encourage people to travel around the worlds. Therefore, there is heavy demand on traveling tool that can help them to have a better traveling experience. The application marks down all the places where the users want to visit in a certain trip and calculates the optimal traveling route for users. The system will provide not only the navigation but also the recommended visiting duration and tips for each place. It has potential to include the function of restaurant recommendation on the optimal route. 


Idea 3 is to redesign maplink.ucsd.edu. 


Idea 4 is to create a map for people that can help them to find their lost personal belonging. 


Idea 5 is a traveling map that provides educational material when you get to a landmark.
