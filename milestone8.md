# Milestone 8 
## Post requests feature
### Ruijia Cheng 
### The upper left sketch is the home page for posting requests. There are two buttons: post new requests and see pending requests. When the user click on the post new request button, it will lead to the post new request page that asking for information like seats available and time to stay. When the user finishes posting and clicks on post, it will go back to the post home page.
### The user can see their previous posts by clicking the see pending post button. There are three possible statues of a post: pending, expired and accepted. Pending means the post is still with in time and no one has accepted yet, so the user can still edit or delete the  post. Expired means when the time runs out, no one accepts the post. Accepted means the post is accepted by some one. And by clicking the accepted post, the post owner can see the information of the person who accepted. 
### Only when the user has no pending posts can the user post new request.
